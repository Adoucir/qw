already coded:
--------------
M:
- minor destruction: might be worth implementing as a replacement for throwing
- major destruction: used for hydras currently, a bit tricky to use in general
- lesser servant: should probably use this sometimes, especially before greater servant is safe
  - use before harder battles?
  - not as good on DD or at low HP
  - don't use if a servant is in sight (or if used recently?)
- greater servant: currently used on BiA monsters or at low HP
  - use before harder battles?
  - not as good on DD or at low HP
  - don't use if a servant is it sight (or if used recently?)
  - teleport away from hostile servants
  - don't teleport with a friendly servant around?
- train Invo up fairly high for greater servant fail
- special DD logic
R:
- sacrifice logic: preferences given by total ordering on set of possible sacrifices (including reject sacrifices)
  - doesn't handle the multioption sacrifices very intelligently currently
- jump ability: should maybe use this to blink to stairs sometimes
- healing: uses this in place of heal wounds sometimes (complicated logic)
- apocalypse:
  - use on very hard monsters
  - don't use if too drained
- special DD logic
- doesn't handle blink/paralyzed (from Ru retaliation) monsters very well at the moment
T:
- berserk:
  - use on hard monsters or when injured
  - monsters need to be close
- trog's hand:
  - use against MR-checking monsters
  - also to rest quickly in some locations (orb run, abyss, maybe should do this on zot:5 or V:5 too?)
  - don't use when already in effect
- BiA:
  - use on very hard monsters or when a berserk fails
  - don't use if a friendly BiA is already there
  - only use at 4* when really necessary
  - don't teleport with a berserk friendly BiA in sight?
- special DD logic
- weapon gifts should maybe mean that enchant weapon shouldn't be wasted on weak stuff as much?

should code:
------------
B:
- smite: not sure whether it is worth using? training invo just for this seems bad
- recall:
  - use before most battles?
  - don't use if used recently
- water walking should be taken into account in shallow water functions
- need special code for joining from a priest
- allies might make coward_step strats worse
C:
- first two abilities: not sure whether worth using
- slouch:
  - use against fast monsters (oofs, hasted monsters, etc), maybe other times too?
- step out of time: not sure whether it is worth training invo up for this since it is a bit tricky to use
- slow movement might make tactical steps worse
- don't use hasting on orb run
- train Invo up a little for slouch fail rate
- should avoid using weapons of speed (Arga)
O:
- heroism:
  - use before most battles?
  - don't use if already active
- finesse:
  - use before hard battles
  - don't use if already active
- train Invo up a decent amount for heroism duration and finesse fail, not sure how high exactly
- maybe stop training skills at 22 because of heroism
- armour gifts make wand acq more tempting (it already might be better with other gods if lacking wand of tele)
Q:
- upheaval:
  - similar to major destruction but easier to target and more reliable
  - not sure exactly what the best way is of using this
- elemental force:
  - a bit tricky to use because need to count nearby clouds
  - use before hard battles
  - don't use if can see friendly elementals
- apocalypse (except not called that):
  - pretty tricky to use because of the open space requirements
  - creating lava might get qw in trouble too
- probably should use some subset of the abilities and train invo for them, but I'm not sure exactly
- capstone ability: choose rF?
- coward abilities might be bad with Q noise, not sure
Y:
- recall logic is similar to Beogh
- pain mirror:
  - use against very hard enemies?
  - might waste too much piety
- life draining:
  - a bit tricky to check monster susceptibility, also only want to use with lots of monsters on screen
- probably should train invo up a bit but not that much?
- coward_step stuff might be worse with allies
- should avoid using holy weapons

might code:
-----------
E: pacified monster handling might be annoying, though could just not use the ability
H: probably want to wait until the god is more stable, but shouldn't be too hard after that
J: altar availability makes this not that attractive to code
L: banish MR check and beaminess might be tricky, as would be corrupt
U: wait until the god is more stable, but shouldn't be too hard after that
X: might still be issues with weapon swapping or unwielding causing skill screen stuff, should check this
Z: recite and sanctuary usage might be tricky

not coding for now:
-----------
A: curse logic is hard
D: stabby is hard
F: these abilities are a bit tricky and I don't know the god very well
G: these abilities are a bit tricky and food might be an issue
K: casty is hard
N: decks are complicated and use up lots of inventory
P: evocables are complicated and use up lots of inventory (could maybe do DD of P though)
S: casty is hard
V: casty is hard
